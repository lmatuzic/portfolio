      <h2>Personal</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Luka MatuziÄ‡ and I am web developer who is passionate about developing efficient, scalable, responsive and beautiful web applications and websites. My journey into
        web development evolved from a desire to make something completely on my own and while I'm at it - to make it look good. I have enjoyed doing web development for almost 2 years now. 
        I use a variety of techonologies for my personal projects, but also for a company in which I currently work. I have a great desire to learn and discover new things, to meet new 
        people and to solve the problems that are set before me.
